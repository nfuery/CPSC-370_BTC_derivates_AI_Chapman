# Software Development Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the software development process and coding standards for the decentralized dating app project. The goal of this project is to create a secure, transparent, and user-centric dating platform that leverages blockchain technology.

## 2. Development Process

### 2.1 Design

The design phase involves creating a detailed plan of the system's architecture and functionality. This includes defining the system's components, their interactions, and the data they manage.

### 2.2 Implementation

During the implementation phase, developers write the code that makes up the system. This includes developing the user interface with Svelte, implementing the backend logic with PlanetScale, and managing the database with Prisma ORM.

### 2.3 Testing

The testing phase involves verifying that the system works as expected. This includes unit testing individual components, integration testing the system as a whole, and stress testing the system under heavy load.

### 2.4 Deployment

The deployment phase involves deploying the system to a production environment. This includes setting up the PlanetScale database, deploying the Svelte frontend, and launching the Prisma ORM service.

## 3. Coding Standards

### 3.1 General Standards

- Code should be written in a clear and concise manner.
- Code should be well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each section.
- Code should be organized into logical modules or components.
- Code should be regularly committed to a version control system with meaningful commit messages.
- Code should be tested thoroughly, with unit tests covering at least 70% of the codebase.
- Code should be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged into the main branch.

### 3.2 TypeScript Standards

- Use `let` and `const` for variable declaration.
- Use arrow functions where possible.
- Use template literals for string concatenation.
- Use destructuring assignment where possible.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`.
- Use `Array.prototype.map()`, `Array.prototype.reduce()`, `Array.prototype.filter()`, and `Array.prototype.find()` instead of traditional `for` loops where possible.
- Use types and interfaces to enforce type safety.
- Use modules to organize code.
- Use decorators where appropriate.
- Always use <script lang="ts"> for TypeScript code.

### 3.3 Svelte Standards

- Use single-file components with a `.svelte` extension.
- Use the <script lang="ts"> tag for TypeScript code.
- Use the `<style>` tag for CSS.
- Use the `{}` syntax for data binding.
- Use Svelte's reactivity features, such as reactive statements (`$:`) and reactive declarations (`let`).
- Use Svelte's built-in directives, such as `{#if}`, `{#each}`, and `{#await}`.
- Use Svelte's component lifecycle functions, such as `onMount`, `beforeUpdate`, and `afterUpdate`.

### 3.4 Prisma ORM Standards

- Follow the [Prisma Style Guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema).
- Use the `model` keyword to define a model.
- Use the `@id` attribute for primary keys.
- Use the `@relation` attribute to define relations between models.
- Use the `prisma` client to interact with the database.
- Use Prisma's query methods, such as `findUnique`, `findMany`, `create`, `update`, and `delete`.
- Use Prisma's transaction methods, such as `transaction` and `commit`.

4. Enforcing Standards
To ensure adherence to these standards, we will employ ESLint with appropriate TypeScript and Svelte plugins. A pre-commit hook will be set up to run ESLint, and code reviews will include a check for compliance with these standards. Continuous integration pipelines will also run automated tests and linting to maintain code quality throughout the development process.

## 5. Conclusion

This document provides a detailed overview of the software development process and coding standards for the decentralized dating app project. By adhering to these guidelines and enforcing them through ESLint, the development team can ensure that the system is well-designed, well-implemented, and well-tested.
